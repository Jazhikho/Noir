# Elevator Pitch 

“A washed-up detective escapes the monotony of his grayscale office as color invades the outside world.”

## Concept
Private Eye Pierce & The Ink Spill is a point-and-click 2D sidescroller taking place in a black-and-white comic world. The protagonist, P.I Pierce, has been investigating the colorful ink spill spreading through the city and now finds himself locked in his office building. He’ll explore the different rooms, talking to other surreal characters and solving puzzles as works towards his escape.
